      weight 0.09068314 -0.1227179  1.00000000
      
      Correlation matrix between mpg and length - shows some correlation however, mpg and weight shows no correlation.
      
      Plots - between mpg and length shows positive correlation - meaning as the vehicle length increases mpg tends to increase          somewhat as well.

Linear Model

      Coefficients:
      (Intercept)       length  
          -25.062        4.673  
          
       Multiple R-squared:  0.3715  
       p-value: 2.632e-06
       
       R-squared 0.37 indicates that 37% of all mpg predictions with          vehicle length will be correct using linear model. In addition,        p-value is much smaller than assumed significance level of 0.05%        . Therefore, we reject null hypothesis and that the slope of           linear model is not zero.
       
       
      Visualization in combination with caculated p-value and r-squared       value - there is a positive relationship between length and mpg.

MULTIPLE Linear Regression Model

 Multiple R-squared:  0.7149

1) Vehicle length and Vehicle clearance Pr value is very small indicating that they are statistically unlikely to provider randome amounts to the linear model. Or length and clearance have a significant impact on mpg than other variables.

2) There is a positive slope as the p value is much smaller than 0.05%.

3) r squared value increased from 0.37 to 0.71 in multiple linear regression model. Also - since the amount of information obtained and analzed are greater with multiple linear regression model. This model predict that vehicle length and vehicle clearance will have significant impact on mpg.

Design your own study

fuel efficiency and horse power  could be interests of consumer since that affects how fast cars can speed up and also the fuel cost.

hypothesis - could be if there is a significance difference between MechaCar fuel efficiency and Horse Power vs other cars.

Need to collect fuel data, horse power data, manufacturer data
